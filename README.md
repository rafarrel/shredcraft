# Contributing
Contribution guidelines are still being worked out. However, if you would like to join the project, reach at to Alex at: ralexfarrell@outlook.com. 

The goal of this project is to create a community-driven open source skiing addon for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. We welcome any contributions!

## Testing changes in-game

After making changes to addon packs during development, run the following command to copy the changes to Minecraft's 'com.mojang' folder so they can be tested in-game:
```
python scripts/copy_addons.py
```
Now, restart the testing game world with the addon packs activated and all changes should be seen automatically.
